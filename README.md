SpaceX Falcon 9 Data Science Project

This repository contains notebooks and supporting materials for the SpaceX Falcon 9 data analysis and machine learning project, completed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.

The project covers data collection, exploratory analysis, visualization, and model development to predict Falcon 9 first-stage landing success.
