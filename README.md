# 🚀 SpaceX Falcon 9 Data Science Project

**IBM Data Science Professional Certificate – Capstone**

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains the complete **data analysis, visualization, and machine learning workflow** for the **SpaceX Falcon 9 launch success prediction project**, developed as part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**.

The project walks through the **entire data science lifecycle** — from data collection and cleaning to exploratory analysis, interactive visualization, and predictive modeling.

📓 **Note:** If GitHub does not render the `.ipynb` files correctly, you can:

* Download and open them locally using **Jupyter Notebook**
* Upload them to **Google Colab**
* Use any other Jupyter-compatible environment

## 📂 Project Structure & Contents

### **1️⃣ Data Collection (API)**

* Collected SpaceX launch data using the **SpaceX REST API**
* Extracted launch details, payload information, and landing outcomes

---

### **2️⃣ Web Scraping**

* Scraped Falcon 9 launch records from Wikipedia
* Parsed HTML tables using **BeautifulSoup** and **Pandas**

---

### **3️⃣ Data Wrangling**

* Cleaned missing values
* Standardized categorical variables
* Converted data types for analysis and modeling

---

### **4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

#### 🔹 EDA with SQL

* Queried launch data using **SQL** to identify patterns and trends

#### 🔹 EDA with Python

* Used **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** for statistical analysis and visualization

---

### **5️⃣ Visual Analytics**

#### 🗺️ Folium Maps

* Visualized launch sites and landing outcomes on interactive maps

#### 📊 Plotly Dash

* Built interactive dashboards using:
