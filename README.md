# SpaceX Falcon 9 Data Science Project

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and supporting files for the SpaceX Falcon 9 data analysis and machine learning project completed as part of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.
The project focuses on collecting launch data, performing exploratory data analysis, building visualizations, and developing machine learning models to predict the success of Falcon 9 first-stage landings.

## Contents

1. **Data Collection (API)**
   Collecting Falcon 9 launch data using the SpaceX REST API.

2. **Web Scraping**
   Scraping launch records and payload information from Wikipedia.

3. **Data Wrangling**
   Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and preparing data for analysis.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * EDA using SQL
   * EDA using Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib

5. **Visual Analytics**

   * Interactive maps using Folium
   * Dashboards built with Plotly Dash (JupyterDash and standalone Dash)

6. **Machine Learning Models**
   Building and evaluating classification models to predict launch success, including hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.

7. **Flowcharts**
   Visual representations of the project workflow and modeling process.

8. **Supplemental Pictures**
   Images used for presentations and documentation.

## Tools and Technologies
Python, Pandas, NumPy, SQL, Folium, Plotly Dash, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook
